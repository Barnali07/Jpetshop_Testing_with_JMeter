I’ve completed a performance test on a frequently used API for the test App. 
Test executed for the below-mentioned scenario in website jpetstore.


20 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 60 And Total Concurrent API requested: 5100.
25 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 69 And Total Concurrent API requested: 6375.
35 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 100 And Total Concurrent API requested:8925.
70 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 201 And Total Concurrent API requested: 17850.
140 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 355 And Total Concurrent API requested: 35640.

While executing 140 concurrent requests, found that 1 request got a connection timeout, and the error rate is 1.30%. 

The server can handle almost concurrent 28000 API calls with less than  one percent(1%) error rate.

Please find the details report in the attachment and let me know if you have any further queries.
